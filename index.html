            The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India[10]
            and Men in Blue,[11] is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket
            in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket
            Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20
            International (T20I) status. Cricket was introduced to India by
            British sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was
            established in 1792. India's national cricket team did not play its
            first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth
            team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait
            until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first
            fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker
            teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The
            team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of
            players such as batsmen Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the
            Indian spin quartet.

            he Australia men's national cricket team represents Australia in
            men's international cricket. As the joint oldest team in Test
            cricket history, playing in the first ever Test match in 1877,[9]
            the team also plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20
            International (T20I) cricket, participating in both the first ODI,
            against England in the 1970–71 season[10] and the first T20I,
            against New Zealand in the 2004–05 season,[11] winning both games.
            The team draws its players from teams playing in the Australian
            domestic competitions – the Sheffield Shield, the Australian
            domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and the Big Bash League.
            The national team has played 834 Test matches, winning 394, losing
            226, drawing 212 and tying 2.[12] As of January 2021, Australia is
            ranked third in the ICC Test Championship on 113 rating points.[13]
            Australia is the most successful team in Test cricket history, in
            terms of overall wins, win-loss ratio and wins percentage.

            The England cricket team represents England and Wales in
            international cricket. Since 1997, it has been governed by the
            England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously
            governed by Marylebone Cricket Club (the MCC) since 1903.[8][9]
            England, as a founding nation, is a Full Member of the International
            Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and
            Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Until the 1990s, Scottish and
            Irish players also played for England as those countries were not
            yet ICC members in their own right. England and Australia were the
            first teams to play a Test match (15–19 March 1877), and along with
            South Africa, these nations formed the Imperial Cricket Conference
            (the predecessor to today's International Cricket Council) on 15
            June 1909. England and Australia also played the first ODI on 5
            January 1971. England's first T20I was played on 13 June 2005, once
            more against Australia.

            The New Zealand national cricket team represents New Zealand in
            men's international cricket. Nicknamed the Blackcaps, they played
            their first Test in 1930 against England in Christchurch, becoming
            the fifth country to play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to
            wait until 1956, more than 26 years, for its first Test victory,
            against the West Indies at Eden Park in Auckland.[13] They played
            their first ODI in the 1972–73 season against Pakistan in
            Christchurch. The current captain in all formats of the game is Kane
            Williamson, who replaced Brendon McCullum after the latter's
            retirement in December 2015. The national team is organised by New
            Zealand Cricket. The New Zealand cricket team became known as the
            Blackcaps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear
            Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the
            team.[14] This is one of many national team nicknames related to the
            All Blacks.

            India at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi, in October 1952, with India
            winning by an innings and 70 runs.[19] In the 1930s and 40s, several
            Pakistani Test players had played Test cricket for the Indian
            cricket team before the creation of Pakistan in 1947.[citation
            needed] The team has played 933 ODIs, winning 490, losing 414, tying

            champion, and was the runner-up in the 1999 tournament. Pakistan, in
            conjunction with other countries in South Asia, has hosted the 1987
            and 1996 World Cups, with the 1996 final being hosted at Gaddafi
            Stadium in Lahore.
